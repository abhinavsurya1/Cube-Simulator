Most Optimal Strategy for Solving the Rubik’s Cube
The optimal strategy for solving a Rubik’s Cube in the fewest moves is to aim for God’s Number, which is 20 moves or fewer in the Half-Turn Metric (HTM), where a 180-degree turn counts as one move. The most practical and efficient algorithm for achieving near-optimal solutions (close to 20 moves) is Kociemba’s Two-Phase Algorithm. This algorithm is widely used in computer solvers and is ideal for your 3D model due to its balance of speed, efficiency, and reasonable move counts (typically 20–30 moves in practice).
Why Kociemba’s Algorithm?

Efficiency: It solves the cube in two phases, reducing the search space significantly compared to brute force.
Near-Optimal Solutions: While not always achieving the absolute minimum (20 moves), it consistently produces solutions close to optimal (often within 20–25 moves).
Feasibility: It requires precomputed lookup tables that are manageable in size (a few megabytes) compared to the 307,346 exabytes needed for brute force.
Suitability for 3D Visualization: The algorithm generates a sequence of moves that can be easily animated in a 3D model, showing step-by-step progress from scrambled to solved.

Overview of Kociemba’s Two-Phase Algorithm
The algorithm divides the solving process into two phases, reducing the cube’s state to a smaller subgroup at each step:

Phase 1: Transform the cube from any scrambled state to a state in the G1 subgroup, where:

All edge orientations are corrected (all edges are in a “good” orientation).
All corner orientations are corrected (all corners are in a “good” twist).
The cube’s permutation belongs to the subgroup where the edges of the U (up) and D (down) faces stay in those faces.
This phase typically takes 8–12 moves.
The search space is reduced to about 2 billion states (specifically, $2^{11} \times 3^7 \times \binom{12}{4} \div 2 \approx 2.11 \text{ billion}$).


Phase 2: Solve the cube from the G1 subgroup to the solved state, where:

The corners and edges are permuted to their correct positions.
The cube is fully solved.
This phase also takes about 8–12 moves.
The search space is further reduced to about 19.5 million states.



Total Moves: The combined phases typically require 20–25 moves, though solutions closer to 20 are possible with optimal pruning tables.
Implementation: The algorithm uses iterative deepening depth-first search (IDA)* with precomputed pruning tables to efficiently find a solution. These tables store the minimum number of moves needed to reach G1 (Phase 1) or the solved state (Phase 2) for a subset of states, allowing the algorithm to prune branches that would exceed the current depth limit.
Why Not Other Methods?

Brute Force: As calculated, storing all configurations requires 307,346 exabytes, which is infeasible.
Optimal Solvers (e.g., Cube Explorer): These aim for exactly 20 moves but require massive computational resources and larger lookup tables (hundreds of gigabytes). Kociemba’s algorithm is faster and more practical for real-time 3D applications.
Beginner Methods (e.g., Layer-by-Layer): These are intuitive but produce longer solutions (50–100 moves), which are less efficient and less engaging for a 3D model.
CFOP/Fridrich Method: Popular for speedcubing, but solutions are typically 50–60 moves and rely on human intuition, making it less suitable for automated 3D solving.

Building a 3D Model for Solving Any Scrambled State
To create a 3D model that solves any scrambled Rubik’s Cube state using Kociemba’s algorithm, here’s a step-by-step approach:
1. Choose a 3D Framework
Select a 3D graphics library or framework to render and animate the cube. Recommended options:

Three.js (JavaScript): Web-based, widely used, supports 3D animations, and works across platforms.
Unity (C#): Ideal for standalone applications or games, with robust 3D rendering and physics.
Blender with Python: Good for high-quality visualizations, though less suited for real-time interactive apps.

Why Three.js? It’s lightweight, web-accessible, and perfect for animating cube rotations in a browser, making it easy to share and integrate with a solver.
2. Model the Rubik’s Cube

Representation: Model the cube as 26 visible cubies (8 corners, 12 edges, 6 centers) or as 54 stickers on a 3x3x3 grid. Each cubie/sticker has a position and color.
Internal State: Internally, represent the cube’s state using:

Corner permutations (8 cubies).
Edge permutations (12 cubies).
Corner orientations (0, 1, or 2 for each of 7 corners).
Edge orientations (0 or 1 for each of 11 edges).
This requires about 64 bits per state, as calculated earlier.


3D Geometry: Create cubie models (e.g., small cubes with colored faces) with slight gaps to visualize rotations. Use a 3x3x3 matrix to track cubie positions.

3. Implement Kociemba’s Algorithm

Library Choice: Use an existing implementation to save time:

JavaScript: Libraries like kociemba.js or cubing.js (available on GitHub) implement Kociemba’s algorithm and can be integrated with Three.js.
Python: Use pycuber or kociemba for prototyping, then port to your 3D framework.
C#: Implement Kociemba’s algorithm manually in Unity or adapt an open-source solver.


Steps:

Input Scrambled State: Allow users to input a scrambled cube state (e.g., via a UI to color stickers or by applying random moves).
Convert to Internal Representation: Map the visual cube to corner/edge permutations and orientations.
Run Kociemba’s Algorithm:

Generate pruning tables (or download precomputed ones, typically a few MB).
Execute Phase 1 to reach G1, then Phase 2 to solve the cube.
Output a sequence of moves (e.g., U R2 F' D L ...).


Validate Solution: Ensure the move sequence solves the cube by applying it to the internal state.


Optimization: Precompute and store pruning tables (a few MB) to speed up searches. For real-time performance, cache common solutions if memory allows.

4. Animate the Solution in 3D

Move Application: For each move in the solution (e.g., U for upper face clockwise), rotate the corresponding face (e.g., 9 cubies for the U face) by 90 degrees.
Animation: Use smooth interpolation (e.g., quaternions in Three.js) to animate face rotations. Ensure the animation reflects HTM (180-degree turns as one move).
User Interaction:

Allow pausing, stepping through moves, or adjusting animation speed.
Highlight the face being turned for clarity.
Display the move notation (e.g., U, R2, F') alongside the animation.


Visual Feedback: Show progress (e.g., edges orienting in Phase 1, final solve in Phase 2) to make the process educational.

5. Input and Output

Input Methods:

Manual: Let users color the cube’s stickers via a 2D or 3D interface.
Random Scramble: Apply 20–30 random moves to generate a valid scrambled state.
Camera Input: Use computer vision (e.g., OpenCV) to scan a real cube’s state via webcam, though this is advanced.


Output: Display the solution as:

A list of moves (e.g., U R2 F' D ...).
An animated sequence in the 3D model.
Optionally, export the solution as text or video.



6. Optimizations for 3D Model

Reduce Move Count: After generating a solution, apply move cancellation (e.g., U U becomes U2, U U' cancels out) to shorten the sequence for smoother animation.
Precompute Tables: Store Kociemba’s pruning tables locally (a few MB) to avoid recomputation.
Performance: Use efficient data structures (e.g., bit-packed states) and optimize rendering (e.g., limit draw calls in Three.js).
User Experience: Add features like undo/redo, reset, or a “solve slowly” mode for educational purposes.

7. Tools and Resources

Libraries:

Three.js for 3D rendering (web-based).
cubing.js or kociemba.js for the solver (JavaScript).
Unity with a C# solver for standalone apps.


Tutorials:

Search for “Three.js Rubik’s Cube” on GitHub for open-source 3D cube projects.
Check Kociemba’s official site or GitHub for algorithm details and pruning tables.


Testing: Validate the solver with known scrambles (e.g., from speedcubing competitions) to ensure accuracy.

Example Workflow for Your 3D Model

User Input: User scrambles the cube via a UI or uploads a photo of a real cube.
State Parsing: Convert the visual state to corner/edge permutations and orientations.
Solve: Run Kociemba’s algorithm to generate a move sequence (e.g., U R2 F' D2 ...).
Animate: In the 3D model, animate each move with smooth rotations, updating cubie positions.
Display: Show the move list and allow the user to step through or replay the solution.

Why This Approach Is Best

Optimality: Kociemba’s algorithm ensures solutions close to God’s Number (20 moves), making it efficient and visually concise.
Feasibility: Requires only a few MB of storage for pruning tables, unlike brute force.
Interactivity: The move sequence is easy to animate, enhancing the 3D model’s educational and visual appeal.
Scalability: Works for any valid scrambled state and can be extended with features like speed controls or move annotations.

Additional Considerations

Error Handling: Validate input states to ensure they’re solvable (e.g., check parity and orientation constraints).
Accessibility: Add colorblind-friendly modes or text-based move descriptions.
Advanced Features: Include a “hint” system (e.g., show Phase 1 progress) or allow users to apply moves manually and see the solver adjust.
